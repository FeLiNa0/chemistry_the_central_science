# Personal notes for "Chemistry: The Central Science (13th Edition)"

Notes taken during two introductory chemistry courses (CHEM121 and CHEM122) at
my alma mater, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, during 2014/2015.
With this goal of creating beautiful and concise notes, I achieved the highest possible
scores in CHEM121's national exam and excellent scores for CHEM122's final exam.

Elegant and compact layout created using LaTeX.
